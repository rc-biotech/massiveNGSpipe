\itemize{
\item Biorpoject ID (Only numbers)\cr
\item Bioproject accession (PRJ)\cr
\item SRA study (SRA)\cr
\item ENA study (ERA)\cr
\item GEO study (GSE)\cr

current google sheet or local csv is ready.
}}

\item{config}{path, default \code{ORFik::config()}, where will
fastq, bam, references and ORFik experiments go}

\item{organisms}{character vector, default "all" (Use all organisms found).
Else binomial latin name with capital letter for genus: "Homo sapiens" etc.}

\item{google_url}{url or sheet object for google sheet to use. Set to NULL to
not use google sheet.}

\item{complete_metadata}{path, default file.path(project_dir, "RFP_FINAL_LIST.csv").
The list of final candidates that are checked and have unique rows per bioproject}

\item{LibraryLayouts}{character vector, default c("SINGLE", "PAIRED"),
either or both of: c("SINGLE", "PAIRED")}

\item{LibraryStrategy}{character vector, default:
c("RNA-Seq", "miRNA-Seq", "OTHER"). Which library Strategies to keep.
Default is the total set of normal RNA sequencing. (RNA-seq, miRNA-seq,
Ribo-seq, CHIP-seq, CAGE etc.) Change if you only want a subset, or some
rare type.}

\item{libtypes}{character vector, default "RFP". Which NGS library types to
keep from all LIBRARYLAYOUT values. These names are made by mNGSp
automatically. If you made "disome" as a LIBRARYLAYOUT category, then
c("RFP", "disome") will keep both, but exclude any other.}

\item{Platforms}{character vector, default: "ILLUMINA". The sequencer technologies allowed.}

\item{step_mode}{logical, default FALSE. If TRUE, actives browser() and lets you go through
each step in debug mode for full control.}

\item{open_editor}{logical default TRUE. If google URL is defined, open the
sheet. If not, open the DataEditR bord.}

\item{fix_loop}{logical, default TRUE. If TRUE, will create a loop in
the end that runs until your metadata is valid. If you
only want to updata csv / google docs with new data and not try to complete
now, set this to FALSE.}

\item{only_curated}{logical FALSE, if TRUE. Only validate (or fail) based on
inserted accessions (not the full list). Ignored if accessions is NULL.}

\item{update_google_sheet}{logical TRUE, Ignored if google_url is NULL.
If FALSE, will not update sheet after check. This}
}
\value{
logical, TRUE if you had unique rows per accession per organism
}
\description{
Runs an interactive while loop until your metadata is curated and have this property:
Per accession, your study must have a unique set of rows per organism.
Such that ORFik experiment can understand what is what:
(what is Wild type vs experimental), which are replicates etc.
The uniqueness is defined from column LIBRARYTYPE to column INHIBITOR
