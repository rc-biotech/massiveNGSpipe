\usage{
pipeline_validate_metadata(
  dt,
  config,
  accessions = NULL,
  only_curated = FALSE,

  backup_file = config$backup_metadata,
  next_round_file = config$temp_metadata,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{a data.table of all metadata for all studies}

\item{config}{path, default \code{ORFik::config()}, where will
fastq, bam, references and ORFik experiments go}

\item{accessions}{character vector, all candidate accession numbers, allowed types:\cr
\itemize{
\item Biorpoject ID (Only numbers)\cr
\item Bioproject accession (PRJ)\cr
\item SRA study (SRA)\cr
\item ENA study (ERA)\cr
\item GEO study (GSE)\cr
\item NULL (not "NULL", but NULL), don't add new accession, only look if you
current google sheet or local csv is ready.
}}

\item{only_curated}{logical FALSE, if TRUE. Only validate (or fail) based on
inserted accessions (not the full list). Ignored if accessions is NULL.}

\item{output_file}{a path to store final Ribo csv, default config$complete_metadata}

\item{backup_file}{a path to store backup csv, default: config$backup_metadata,
store all runs, even non Ribo-seq, such that it can be used if wanted.}

\item{libtypes}{character vector, default "RFP". Which NGS library types to
keep from all LIBRARYLAYOUT values. These names are made by mNGSp
automatically. If you made "disome" as a LIBRARYLAYOUT category, then
c("RFP", "disome") will keep both, but exclude any other.}
}
\value{
logical, TRUE if valid.
}
\description{
Only checks validity of columns that are set to KEEP = TRUE.
Validity is check by seeing that for each study, per organism,
That there is a unique set of sample columns that identify that sample
}
